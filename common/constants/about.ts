  "Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I'm Muhammad Ikhsan Pramandika, an Information Systems graduate with a dedicated focus on the intersection of IT Quality Assurance and UI/UX Design. I am passionate about crafting digital experiences that are not only intuitive and engaging but also meticulously tested to ensure flawless performance.",

  "My approach is twofold: I build user-centric designs and then I try to break them. As a UI/UX designer, I have delivered intuitive interfaces that achieved an 89.17% Excellent usability score. As a Quality Assurance professional, I have identified and helped resolve over 50 critical bugs in complex financial and management systems using tools like Jira and Postman. This dual perspective allows me to bridge the critical gap between user expectations and technical execution.",

  "I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute to the entire product lifecycleâ€”from the initial wireframe to the final bug-free launch. Having authored  260+ test scenarios and designed over 200 high-fidelity screens  across various projects, I am equipped with a detail-oriented and proactive mindset. I am eager to bring my unique blend of creative design and analytical rigor to a forward-thinking team.",

  "Thank you for visiting. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate and build something exceptional together.",

  "Best Regards,",
